# CrowdBuild - Decentralized Real Estate Investment Platform

A comprehensive smart contract built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity that enables decentralized real estate investment and rental income distribution.

## üè¢ Overview

CrowdBuild allows multiple investors to collectively invest in real estate properties and receive proportional rental income distributions through blockchain-based tokenization. The contract implements the SIP-010 fungible token standard to represent ownership shares in real estate assets.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Investment Features
- **Token-Based Ownership**: SIP-010 compliant fungible tokens representing property shares
- **STX Investment**: Invest Stacks (STX) to receive CrowdBuild Tokens (CBT)
- **Proportional Returns**: Rental income distributed based on token holdings
- **Flexible Claims**: Token holders can claim their rental income at any time

### Advanced Management Features
- **Voting System**: Token holders vote on property decisions with weight-based voting
- **Maintenance Fund**: Separate fund for property upkeep and improvements
- **Property Metrics**: Track occupancy rates and property values
- **Emergency Controls**: Owner emergency withdraw functionality
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient distribution to multiple token holders

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Expected Returns**: Calculate projected annual returns
- **Dividend History**: Track historical dividend payments
- **Contract Statistics**: Comprehensive metrics for monitoring
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Token price calculation based on property value
